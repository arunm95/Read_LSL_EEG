Read_LSL_EEG

This is a simple program to read EEG from any telemetry/wired EEG device connected to a computer via a National Instruments BNC Data Aqcuisition board.
This syncs the data to LabStreamingLayer, a program which is detailed here: https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer. All files required are included.
This program requires Matlab.

The WIKI contains an example of the UI and how to use the program.
